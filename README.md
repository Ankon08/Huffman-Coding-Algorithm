  Huffman Coding Implementation: This program reads character probabilities from "LettersProbability.txt," constructs
  a Huffman tree, and encodes/decodes input text using the tree. The program assumes UPPERCASE LETTERS in the input text.
  After reading the probability file, it constructs the tree using priority queues, encodes the user-input text, and
  displays the encoded and decoded lines. Each character's encoding is based on its frequency in the probability file.
